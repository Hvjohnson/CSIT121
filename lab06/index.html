<p>Bee, a working class Eastern European woman tags along with her wealthy girlfriend
    Sophie, to a hurricane party held at her friend David's mansion; accompanied by her other very 
    wealthy friends. </p>
<p> As the hurricane begins, the groups decided to play a murder mystery game: Bodies Bodies Bodies,
    which turns into a real life murder mystery as the night goes on. The movie has a very specific
    kind of humour that best relates to the Gen Z audience. </p>
<p> It does a good job at portraying
    the insecurities and petty rivalries of young 20-somethings as they are tested with the suspense and gore that the night brings them.</p>
