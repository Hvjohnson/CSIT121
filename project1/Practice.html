<h2>Activity 1</h2>
<a href="BoxModelPractice.html" target="_blank">Box Model</a>
<p> In this assignment, I was able to play around with the Box Model and test 
    out different styles. </p>
<p>This assignment allowed us to also play around with the float technique and positioning. 
</p>

<h2>Activity 2</h2>
<a href="imagePractice.html" target="_blank">Image Practice</a>
<p>This activity allowed us to explore inserting images into our projects in the html code and in our CSS>
I had some issues with this assignment, but after further searching and using other sources for 
learning HTML, I realized that my main issue was including the correct pathways for where my images were stored. 
This made it hard for VS Code to find my image.
